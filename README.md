# Stability Analysis of Turbulent Fluid Flows

Repository for my undergraduate honors defense in turbulent fluid dynamics and stability analysis, which can be found [here](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/mathcs_honors/92/). 

In the file "Placeholder" is the Arnoldi iterations code, appended to a modified OpenFOAM IcoFOAM solver (details on the original IcoFOAM can be found [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-incompressible-icoFoam.html)).

In the file anamoly_detection_algorithm.ipynb, you can find the code to run the TDA-based real-time anamoly detection algorithm referenced in Section 6. The data needed is in the compressed vert_timeseries folders.
