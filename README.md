# Stability Analysis of Turbulent Fluid Flows

Repository for my undergraduate honors defense in turbulent fluid dynamics and stability analysis, which can be found [here](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/mathcs_honors/92/). 

In the file LNSEFoam.C is the Arnoldi iterations code, appended to a modified OpenFOAM IcoFOAM solver (details on the original IcoFOAM can be found [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-incompressible-icoFoam.html)).
